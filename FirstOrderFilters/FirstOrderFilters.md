# First Order Low-Pass/Hi-Pass Filter Theory

## Low-Pass Filter

- The LPF in this repo, "lowPassFO", is vectorized but does not implement real time I/O. This method writes data to an empty array of zeros instead.
- This filter is an example of an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) due to the recursive nature of the function. See equation below
  - h
